## 4.25.0 (2024-08-18)

* New DNS plugins
  * [TencentDNS](https://dnspod.com/) which is a new plugin for DNSPod that uses the Tencent Cloud API which will eventually be required when the old DNSPod API is terminated. (#553) (Thanks @xiaotiannet)
  * [OnlineNet](https://www.scaleway.com/en/domains-and-dns/) which is Scaleway's legacy DNS API managed through `console.online.net`. (#557)
* Gandi plugin now supports Personal Access Tokens (PAT) auth in addition to legacy API Keys (#554)
* NameCom plugin now has better error handling and debug logs. NameCom users with 2FA enabled should also review the user guide about a setting that could break API access. (#556)
* Minor logging fix for Active24 plugin.
* Fixed a bug with ARI implementation that would fail renewals when the ACME server believes the replaced cert had already been replaced. (#560)
* Fixed a bug with ARI implementation that would throw errors when the cert being replaced did not contain an AKI extention. (#561)
